#Heart Disease Classification
Greetings! ❤️ Excited to introduce our Heart Disease Classification project—a simple yet impactful exploration into the realm of cardiovascular health. Using the power of machine learning, we aim to classify instances of heart disease based on various health parameters.

Wondering how it works? It's all about leveraging data to discern patterns and create a tool that can predict the likelihood of heart disease. Our mission is to make this crucial health assessment more accessible and efficient.
